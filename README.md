Hi, I'm Ben!

I'm interested in coding, computers, science, and technology, and I've been working with all three since my dad brought a computer home from work years before most people cared about them. I'm always looking to improve my existing skills and find new ones like I did back then. I work with C# at work using the .NET framework but C++ was my first love and I miss it sometimes. There's a lot of technology I'd love to work with professionally, such as Python, but I'm always open to and curious about learning anything and everything.

I also love playing my violin but sadly, GitHub doesn't consider that a programming language.
